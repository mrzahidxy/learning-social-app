      "Real-time features introduce constant movement in otherwise static applications. The winning strategy is to keep SSR for first paint and progressively enhance with streaming data once the connection is ready.",
      "Start by defining a shared contract for messages. Typed payloads running through a lightweight event bus keep your stores predictable. Svelte stores remain great for local fan-out, while a single connection is sufficient for most dashboards.",
      "When interactions require instant feedback, send optimistic updates to the UI and schedule reconciliation logic that swaps in the authoritative state. Make sure to surface loading and sync indicators so people trust the interface.",
      "Operationally, monitor for back pressure. Batch low priority updates, compress payloads, and lean on server heartbeats so the client can recover quickly when the connection drops."
